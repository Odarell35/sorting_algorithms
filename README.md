# Bubble sorting algorithm -> sorts data by comparing  two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in a desired order.

Time Complexity:
Best : O(n)

Worst : O(n^2)

Average : O(n^2)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Insertion sorting algorithm -> sorts data by placing an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.

Time Complexity:
Best : O(n)

Worst : O(n^2)

Average : O(n^2)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Selection sorting algorithm -> sorts data by selecting the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

Time Complexity:
Best : O(n^2)

Worst : O(n^2)

Average : O(n^2)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick sort algorithm -> based on the divide and conquer approach.

An element selected from the array which will be used to array into subarrays, this is repeated until elements are combined to form a sorted array.


Time Complexity:
Best : O(n*log n)

Worst : O(n^2)

Average : O(n*log n)
